00.log - Created a new user and paired the sensor from scratch and collected data for ~20 minutes. 
	 This should have the pairing process as well as data. There is roughly 7 exchanges between Pixel and Sensor before temps are sent.
	 Line 328-388 seem to be the "pairing process". Line 388 contains the "trigger".
	 The temperatures recorded on the app were:
101.7
101.7
101.7
101.8
101.8
102.2
101.8
102.0
102.0
100.8
100.8
**Each of these values appear to have been 60 seconds apart.(Look at lines 468-478, the time difference is 60seconds).

01.log- Battery was unplugged, and the phone was restarted, but the sensor and user were kept on the RadiusT app.
	Sensor light was green until opening the app then went solid blue. Once the app opened, the UI on the app never updated (was stuck reading last updated xxxMinutes ago).
	However, there is data logged, their UI just sucks. In the log the 7 exchanges are in fact repeated before data was streamed. Unfortunately, I don't know what these values are 
	since the UI never updated itself. Line 221-245 appear to be the "pairing process". Line 245 contains the believed to be "trigger" commmand for this sensor, since everything after this is just data.
	So the "pairing process" is in fact repeated. This leads me to believe that its not really a pairing process but maybe more of a syncing processing.
