# masimo_radius_t

The two log files can be opened in Wireshark. Notes on how they were acquired are in the log_notes.txt file.

Briefly:
* 00.log captures the complete pairing and data acquisition process
* 01.log starts with the Pixel and Radius-T already paired, so they just need to connect, trigger, and then data-stream

Connections are between Google Pixel and a [Masimo Radius-T](https://www.masimo.com/products/sensors/radius-t/)
